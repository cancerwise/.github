# CANCERWISE
CANCERWISE - Cancer Early Warning System - Product Capstone Project Bangkit 2023 (Batch 1).

Presenting "**CANCERWISE**", a mobile app that provides early detection of cancer. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), cancer is responsible for one in six deaths globally. Even though the reason for this high mortality rate is the lack of early detection. We find that conventional methods for cancer detection are hard to find in remote places, and even if that place is accessible the cost for that isn’t affordable for most of the population. With that being said, our application is here to answer that problem. We provide an easy-understanding test on early cancer detection that is accessible to everyone for free. 

Powered with machine learning technology, we will provide reliable and accurate feedback **based on selected symptoms users are experiencing**. Our machine learning algorithm then will process the given information by estimating whether or not the user has some degree of cancer. Users then will be given some suggestions based on that estimation. We believe that early intervention in cancer is one of the best ways to answer cancer's high-risk death problem.
